These scripts are made to test the integrity of AMBERff in NAMD through single point energy comparisons.

To make use of these scripts run the singlePoint_energyTests.sh script in a directory  where the scripts directory is located
and all force field files to be tested are located in the forcefield directory.

Currently there are two test cases available:
  1. Single-point energy comparison for all residues found in the topology file
  2. (For protein force fields only ) Single-point energy comparison of all possible tripeptide combinations found in the topology file
