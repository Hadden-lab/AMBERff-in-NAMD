PSFGEN usage:
1. Load rtf into psfgen prior to generating segments
 - topology path/to/AMBERff-in-NAMD/OL3/OL3.rtf

NAMD usage:
1. Call namdrc.OL3 in the NAMD input file to ensure proper loading and replacement of parameters
 - source         path/to/AMBERff-in-NAMD/OL3/namdrc.OL3
2. Since this is an amber forcefield, the 1-4 scaling must be manually defined in the NAMD configuration file
        2.a) Using the parameters below is consistent with the Amber MD engines 'pmemd' and 'sander' for the OL3 forcefield.
 - exclude        scaled1-4
 - 1-4scaling     0.83333333
        2.b) Setting up PME, the periodic cell, thermostat, barostat, and output parameters are consistent with a typical NAMD simulation


Notes:
For the first A residue appearing in the sequence, tleap uses defines a particular improper as C4-C8-N9-C1' while the rest of the A residues appearing in the sequence are defined as C8-C4-N9-C1'.

to get energy matches between AMBER and NAMD, use apply FIA patch to the first A residue in the sequence.
